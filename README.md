## STEP 1:PROBLEM DEFINITION
Business Context:

We are developing a Sales Management Database System for a retail company that sells different products to customers through various sellers across multiple regions. The company deals with hundreds of transactions every month, but all sales data is currently scattered in spreadsheets and manual reports, making it difficult to track performance and make data-driven decisions.

Data Challenge:

The main challenge is that the company cannot easily analyze its sales performance, identify its best-selling products, track customer purchasing behavior, or evaluate seller performance. Without a centralized database, generating sales reports, calculating revenue growth, or segmenting customers becomes time-consuming and error-prone.

Expected Outcome:

The goal is to design a relational database that stores all important business data — including customer details, product information, seller records, and transaction history — in one organized system. This database will enable the company to:

Quickly access accurate sales data

Generate reports and insights (e.g., top products, monthly revenue, loyal customers)

Improve decision-making based on real-time information
## STEP 2: SUCCESS CRITERIA
1. Track Customer Purchases: The system should store and retrieve complete purchase history for each customer.
2. Monitor Product Sales: It should generate a list of top-selling products by region, month, or category.
3. Measure Seller Performance: The database should report total revenue generated by each seller.
4. Analyze Sales Growth: It should calculate month-over-month or quarterly revenue growth trends.
5. Segment Customers: The system should classify customers based on their total spending (e.g., high-value vs low-value).

| **transactions** | Record sales transactions     | `transaction_id (PK)`, `customer_id (FK)`, `product_id (FK)`, `seller_id (FK)`, `sale_date`, `amount` | **3001**, 1001, 2001, 4001, 2024-01-15, 25000 |

## STEP 5: RESULTS ANALYSIS
### DESCRIPTIVE
.Top 5 products per region-quarter: Product A, B, C dominate Kigali in Q2; total revenue in Kigali Q2 = 2,450,000 RWF.

.Monthly trend: Sales peaked in July 2025 and dipped in June 2025; moving average confirms upward trend into Q3.

.Customer quartiles: Top quartile (25% customers) contribute ~62% of revenue.

### Diagnostic
.Q3 peak correlates with marketing campaign launched July 1 and introduction of a new seasonal blend (product promotion).

.High concentration in top quartile indicates dependency on a few loyal customers and potential risk if churn occurs.

.Lower performing regions show product-stockouts or limited product mix (inventory constraint).

### Prescriptive
.Target top-quartile customers with loyalty offers to preserve revenue; create a “win-back” campaign for 2nd quartile customers.

.Reallocate inventory and promotional budget to top-performing product-region pairs seen in ranking queries.

.Implement monthly monitoring dashboard using these window queries; trigger alerts when MoM drop > 15%.
